== I really have no idea ==

I do checkout remotes/origin/NewBranch1 and get a deatched HEAD state ...
I do checkout NewBranch1 and get 
Branch NewBranch1 set up to track remote branch NewBranch1 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'NewBranch1'
I so not sure what's what here ...

== git checkout remotes/origin/NewBranch1 ==
Note: checking out 'remotes/origin/NewBranch1'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 3e3a6f5... Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/LesleyB/Testrepo


== git checkout NewBranch1 ==
Branch NewBranch1 set up to track remote branch NewBranch1 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'NewBranch1'


== Maybe I start all over again ==

== getting the NewBranch1 branch out ==
1. Remove all the previous working directories - 
2. use 
    git clone https://github.com/LesleyB/Testrepo.git 
   to get a local copy of the github repo Test repos
3. do 
    git checkout NewBranch1
   followed by  
    git branch -a
    * NewBranch1
      master
	  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
	  remotes/origin/NewBranch1
	  remotes/origin/master
4. the ihavenoidea file turns up in the directory (as expected).


== Just getting the repo out ==

1. Do git clone  https://github.com/LesleyB/Testrepo.git
   Cloning into 'Testrepo'...
   remote: Counting objects: 21, done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.
   remote: Total 21 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
   Unpacking objects: 100% (21/21), done.
   Checking connectivity... done.

2. cd Testrepo/
   ls -l
   total 8

   -rw-rw-r-- 1 lesley lesley  37 Jan 23 23:29 README.md
   Note no ihavenoidea file.

3. git branch -a
  * master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/NewBranch1
  remotes/origin/master
