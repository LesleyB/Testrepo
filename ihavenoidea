== I really have no idea ==

I do checkout remotes/origin/NewBranch1 and get a deatched HEAD state ...
I do checkout NewBranch1 and get 
Branch NewBranch1 set up to track remote branch NewBranch1 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'NewBranch1'
I so not sure what's what here ...

== git checkout remotes/origin/NewBranch1 ==
Note: checking out 'remotes/origin/NewBranch1'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 3e3a6f5... Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/LesleyB/Testrepo


== git checkout NewBranch1 ==
Branch NewBranch1 set up to track remote branch NewBranch1 from origin.

== Maybe I start all over again ==
